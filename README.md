# Astolfo.js Legacy

Astolfo.js Legacy was my first attempt at creating a Discord bot in Node.js, it had minor popularity in small Discords but was ultimately a learning experience for me to get the hang of Node.js.

The bot made use of far too many NPM libraries and lacked any originality, looking back it is rather disappointing but it got the job done.
